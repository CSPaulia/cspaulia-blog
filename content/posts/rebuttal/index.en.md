## Rebuttal Workflow

1. **List out** all reviewer comments and categorize them.

2. Schedule a discussion with your advisor and lab mates/senior students to **talk through** the comments and decide on responses.

3. **List all additional experiments you need to run**, and estimate how much **compute** they will require.

4. Write the rebuttal document.

        - Evidence preparation
            - Theoretical justification: provide detailed derivations; show the full process to senior students and your advisor.
            - Experimental justification: double-check (and re-check) experimental results.
            - Citation justification: clearly point to where the evidence is (e.g., paste the arXiv link).

        - Writing style requirements
            - Address reviewers in the second person (to reduce distance).
            - Be sincere, well-reasoned, logically clear, and human.

        - Drafting process
            - Write the Chinese responses first.
            - Translate with DeepL.
            - Polish with GPT.

5. After finishing, **ask your advisor and senior students to review** it, then submit a unified response.

6. If reviewers respond again, keep discussing:
     - Continue one-on-one communication with senior students and your advisor.
     - Update the rebuttal document.
